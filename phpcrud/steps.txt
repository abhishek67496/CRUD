Setting Up Your Environment:
Install XAMPP: If you havenâ€™t already, download and install XAMPP, which provides an Apache web server, MySQL database, and PHP.
Start XAMPP: Open the XAMPP control panel and start the Apache and MySQL modules.

Database Setup:
Create a Database: In phpMyAdmin (accessible via http://localhost/phpmyadmin), create a new database (e.g., employee).
Create a Table: Inside your database, create a table (e.g., contacts) with columns like id, name, email, and phone.

Project Structure:
Create a project folder (e.g., phpcrud) within the htdocs directory of your XAMPP installation.
Inside this folder, create subfolders for css, js, and images.

HTML and CSS:
Create an index.html file with a form to add new contacts and a table to display existing contacts.
Style your page using CSS (you can use external CSS files or inline styles).

JavaScript (AJAX):
Use JavaScript to handle form submissions without page reloads (AJAX).
Implement functions to add, edit, and delete contacts.

PHP Backend:
Create PHP files (e.g., add_contact.php, edit_contact.php, delete_contact.php) to handle server-side logic.
Connect to the MySQL database using PHP.

Implement CRUD operations:
Create: Insert new contacts into the database.
Read: Fetch contacts from the database and display them.
Update: Edit existing contact details.
Delete: Remove contacts from the database.

Database Queries:
Use SQL queries to interact with the database:
INSERT INTO: Add new contacts.
SELECT FROM: Retrieve contacts.
UPDATE: Modify contact details.
DELETE FROM: Delete contacts.

Displaying Contacts:
Fetch contacts from the database and display them in the HTML table.
Use PHP loops to iterate through the result set.

Form Validation:
Validate user input (e.g., check if email addresses are valid).
Prevent SQL injection by using prepared statements.

Testing:
Test your system thoroughly:
Add contacts.
Edit contact details.
Delete contacts.
Ensure data consistency in the database.

Deployment:
Once everything works locally, consider deploying your project to a live server.
Remember that this is a simplified overview, and you can expand upon it by adding features like authentication, user roles, and better UI/UX.
